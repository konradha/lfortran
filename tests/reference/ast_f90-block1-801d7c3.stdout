program block1
implicit integer (a-z)
integer :: B
block
    use mod, only: example
    import, none
!import, only: B
    B = 10
end block
end program block1
! The variable B is implicitly declared in the scoping unit of the main program.
! The statement IMPORT, NONE makes B inaccessible in the BLOCK construct.
! If the IMPORT, NONE statement is replaced with the IMPORT statement in the
! comment, the program is conformant.
